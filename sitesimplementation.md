# Site Management System Implementation Plan

## 1. Database Structure

### Create New Migrations
You'll need to create new migrations for the site management system:

```
php artisan make:migration create_sites_table
php artisan make:migration create_site_credentials_table
php artisan make:migration create_site_metrics_table
```

The `sites` table would include:
- Basic information (name, URL, description)
- Site type (WordPress, Laravel, etc.)
- Status fields

The `site_credentials` table would store:
- FTP host
- FTP username
- FTP password (encrypted)
- Database host
- Database name
- Database username
- Database password (encrypted)
- Login URL
- Login username
- Login password (encrypted)
- API keys (encrypted)
- Contract start date
- Contract end date
- Contract capacity
- Contract storage usage
- Contract storage limit

The `site_metrics` table would store:
- PHP version
- Memory limit
- Max execution time
- Post max size
- Upload max filesize
- Max input vars
- Server IP
- Lighthouse score
- Last update timestamp



## 2. Models Implementation

Create the necessary models:
```
php artisan make:model Site
php artisan make:model SiteCredential
php artisan make:model SiteMetric
```

Implement relationships between these models:
- A Site has one SiteCredential (one-to-one)
- A Site has many SiteMetrics (one-to-many)

Use Laravel's encryption features for sensitive data in the SiteCredential model.

## 3. Controllers and API Integration

Create controllers for managing sites:
```
php artisan make:controller SiteController --resource
php artisan make:controller SiteCredentialController --resource
php artisan make:controller SiteMetricController
```

Create service classes for API integration:
```
php artisan make:provider SiteMetricsServiceProvider
```

Implement services to fetch data from external APIs:
- Create adapters for different hosting providers
- Implement methods to fetch PHP version, disk usage, etc.
- Set up error handling and logging

## 4. Scheduled Tasks

Set up Laravel scheduled tasks to periodically update site metrics:
- Configure the scheduler in `app/Console/Kernel.php`
- Create commands to fetch and update site metrics
- Implement logic to detect and alert on issues (low disk space, outdated PHP)

## 5. Frontend Implementation

### Routes
Add new routes in `routes/web.php` for the site management system:
- Routes for listing, creating, updating, and deleting sites
- Routes for managing credentials
- Routes for viewing metrics

### Inertia Pages
Create new React pages in `resources/js/pages`:
- Sites index page (list of all sites)
- Site detail page (showing all information)
- Forms for adding/editing sites and credentials

### Components
Create reusable components:
- Site card component
- Credential form component (with proper security handling)
- Metrics visualization components

## 6. Translation Integration

Since you've already set up translation for your application:
- Add all new text strings to your French translation files in `resources/lang/fr`
- Use the translation functions in both backend and frontend code
- Ensure all user-facing text is properly translated

## 7. Security Considerations

Implement proper security measures:
- Use Laravel's encryption for storing credentials
- Implement proper authorization using policies
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations
- Consider using Laravel Sanctum for API authentication if needed

## 8. Testing

Create tests for your implementation:
- Unit tests for models and services
- Feature tests for controllers
- Frontend tests for React components

## Implementation Process

1. Start with the database migrations and models
2. Implement the controllers and basic CRUD operations
3. Create the frontend pages and components
4. Add the API integration services
5. Implement scheduled tasks for data updates
6. Add security features and tests
7. Finalize translations

This approach integrates well with your existing Laravel and Inertia.js application while providing a comprehensive solution for managing multiple websites and their associated information.
